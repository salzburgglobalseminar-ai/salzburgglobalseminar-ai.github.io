	Technology, Growth, and Inequality: The Case of AI
</h1>

The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a double-edged sword in terms of economic
growth and societal inequality. While AI has significantly contributed to productivity
improvements and innovation, leading to economic growth, it has also exacerbated income
and wealth disparities. Studies indicate that AI-driven automation favors high-skill over low-
skill labor, leading to a polarized job market and widening the income gap. According to the
World Economic Forum, AI and automation are set to create 58 million new jobs by 2022,
but the distribution of these opportunities often reflects existing inequalities. Furthermore,
AI's impact on inequality is global, with developed nations harnessing more benefits than
developing countries, potentially widening the global digital divide
